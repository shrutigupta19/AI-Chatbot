# AI-Chatbot
The project is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Microsoft's DialoGPT, a fine-tuned variant of GPT-2 optimized for conversational response generation. The chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversations in a natural and interactive manner.
The project showcases how to integrate pretrained transformer models with a Python interface to create an engaging dialogue system. It can be run in the terminal or through a web interface using Streamlit.
